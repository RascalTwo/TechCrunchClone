But already a debate is raging in the venture capital community and investors are picking sides. On Friday, a group of more than two dozen venture capital […]

	<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/11/silicon-valley-banks-collapse-is-a-human-story/">On Friday, I wrote about how Silicon Valley Bank has been closed by regulators, which are now in charge of the bank’s deposits. The bank is set to reopen Monday, which means we — and I mean that in the most collective sense — are in for a weekend of pause, fear and further questions. This is not a story of the week; it’s a story for the weeks and months ahead. As Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan put it, this could set startups and innovation back by 10 years.
