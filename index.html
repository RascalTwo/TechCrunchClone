	<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/21/get-ready-for-a-lot-of-dead-daos/">After a lengthy crypto bull run, the startups and projects in the space are reining in expectations and settling in for a long-haul crypto winter. It’s been a particularly tough time for DAOs, which are seeing their treasuries and native tokens decline, forcing them to cut back on expenses while trying to drum up enthusiasm […]

University of California, Berkeley researchers are attempting to simplify and shorten that with an innovative learning technique that has the robot filling in the gaps rather than starting from scratch. The team shared several lines of work with […]
